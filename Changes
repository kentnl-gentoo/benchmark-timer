Revision history for Perl extension Benchmark::Timer.

0.4 - March 29, 2001

  * Changed internal method representation to an array instead of a
    hash, for a tiny but measureable speed increase
  * Corrected timestr() to display microseconds and show integral times
  * Added delta.pl, a small script that calculates the approximate
    overhead of using Benchmark::Timer versus plain Time::HiRes calls.

0.3 - March 26, 2001

  * Renamed Time::Timer to Benchmark::Timer after some discussion on
    the comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup

0.2 - March 24, 2001

  * Added $t->result, $t->results, and $t->data methods to access data.
  * warn() instead of puke when $t->report is called while an event is
    still pending (thanks Ilmari Karonen <perl@itz.pp.sci.fi>).


0.1 - March 23, 2001

  * Original version, created by Andrew Ho (andrew@zeuscat.com), rolled.
